    "---\n",
    "In this project, you'll work with text data from newsgroup posts on a variety of topics. You'll train classifiers to distinguish posts by topics inferred from the text. Whereas with digit classification, where each input is relatively **dense** (represented as a 28x28 matrix of pixels, many of which are non-zero), here each document is relatively **sparse** (represented as a **bag-of-words**). Only a few words of the total vocabulary are active in any given document. The assumption is that a label depends only on the count of words, not their order.\n",

    "The `sklearn` documentation on feature extraction may be useful:\n",

    "1. Comment your code.\n",
    "1. All graphs should have titles, label for each axis, and if needed a legend. It should be understandable on its own.\n",
    "1. All code must run on colab.research.google.com\n",
    "1. You should not import any additional libraries.\n",
    "1. Try and minimize the use of the global namespace (meaning keep things in functions).\n",

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "\n",
    "Part 5: KNN does not work well for this because distance between words is rather arbitrary or difficult to encompass. For example, what's the distance between \"Hello\" and \"leaf\"? I'm sure the model has some way to measure distance but its more difficult to do with categorical data vs. quantitative ones (easy as euclidian distance for a metric).  \n",
    "\n",
    "For part 6: Logistic Reg doesn't work as well for this type of data as Naive Bayes because it is prone to overfitting with a large set of featues (aka the vocabulary). Naive Bayes does not have this issue and works fine with many words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Part 7: There seems to be a non-linear correlation between C values and the weighted sum squares. As C increases so does weighted sums. It does seem like it slows down how much higher the weights go like a logarithm pattern"

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea of regularization is to avoid learning very large weights (which are likely to fit the training data, but not generalize well) by adding a penalty to the total size of the learned weights. Logistic regression seeks the set of weights that minimizes errors in the training data AND has a small total size. The default L2 regularization computes this size as the sum of the squared weights (as in Part 3 above). L1 regularization computes this size as the sum of the absolute values of the weights. Whereas L2 regularization makes all the weights relatively small, **L1 regularization drives many of the weights to 0, effectively removing unimportant features**. For this reason, we can use it as a way to do \"feature selection\".\n",

    "ANSWER:  \n",
    "_In our original model our f1 score came out to around 0.68770 with the original vocab size of 26879. In our best modified model (After L1 regularization with strength C = 0.2) our highest f1 score came out to be 0.6911 with vocab size of 358. From this we can see that a lot of our original vocab words did not contribute to our model and we had to heavily reduce from over 20,000 words down to a mere 358 to improve f1 score by about .004. This also shows how well our model works with all the vocab words and maybe it's not worth chopping down most of our vocab for a marginal improvement (unless of course every improvement matters). Intresting to note also that our model would need to be tuned in order for the regularization to increase performance, otherwise we risk making it worse_. "
